## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this repository!

Please commit your changes with proper sign-off. This means that your commit
log message must contain a line that looks like the following one,
with your actual name and email address:

        Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>

Adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` command will add that line
automatically. You can also add it manually as part of your commit
log message or add it afterwards with `git commit --amend -s`.
