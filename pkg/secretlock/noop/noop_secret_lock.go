// stored with noop are unprotected. Therefore, this implementation is be used for testing purposes only.
// Production code must always use pkg/secretlock/local implementation. In order to minimize the impact on existing
// clients, noop is the default implementation in the framework. Therefore, the use of a context.WithSecretLock() option
// with a secretlock/local implementation is highly recommended to secure key storage in the KMS.

// NoLock is a secret lock service that does no key wrapping (keys are not encrypted).
