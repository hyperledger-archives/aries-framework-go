Feature: Decentralized Identifier(DID) exchange between the agents using public did in invitation

  @didexchange_sdk_public_dids_invitation
  Scenario Outline: did exchange e2e flow using public DID in invitation
    Given options "<keyType>" "<keyAgreementType>" "<mediaTypeProfile>"
      And   "Maria" agent is running on "localhost" port "random" with http-binding did resolver url "${SIDETREE_URL}" which accepts did method "sidetree"
      And   "Maria" creates public DID for did method "sidetree"
    # we wait until observer polls sidetree txn
    Then  "Maria" waits for public did to become available in sidetree for up to 10 seconds
      And   "Maria" creates did exchange client
      And   "Maria" registers to receive notification for post state event "completed"

    Given "Lisa" agent is running on "localhost" port "random" with http-binding did resolver url "${SIDETREE_URL}" which accepts did method "sidetree"
      And   "Lisa" creates public DID for did method "sidetree"
    # we wait until observer polls sidetree txn
    Then  "Lisa" waits for public did to become available in sidetree for up to 10 seconds
      And   "Lisa" creates did exchange client
      And   "Lisa" registers to receive notification for post state event "completed"
      And   "Maria" creates invitation with public DID
      And   "Lisa" receives invitation from "Maria"
      And   "Lisa" approves invitation request
      And   "Maria" approves did exchange request
      And   "Maria" waits for post state event "completed"
      And   "Lisa" waits for post state event "completed"

    Then   "Maria" retrieves connection record and validates that connection state is "completed"
      And   "Lisa" retrieves connection record and validates that connection state is "completed"
