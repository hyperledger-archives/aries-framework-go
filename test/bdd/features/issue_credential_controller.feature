Feature: Issue Credential using controller API

  @issue_credential_controller_begin_with_request
  Scenario: The Holder begins with a request
    Given "Driver" agent is running on "localhost" port "8081" with controller "https://localhost:8082"
    And "Institution" agent is running on "localhost" port "11011" with controller "https://localhost:11012"
    And "Driver" has established connection with "Institution" through IssueCredential controller

    When  "Driver" requests credential from "Institution" through IssueCredential controller
    And "Institution" accepts request and sends credential to the Holder through IssueCredential controller

      And "Citizen" accepts an offer and sends a request to the Issuer through IssueCredential controller
      And "Government" accepts request and sends credential to the Holder through IssueCredential controller
      And "Citizen" accepts credential with name "passport" through IssueCredential controller

    Then  "Citizen" checks that issued credential is being stored under "passport" name

  @issue_credential_controller_begin_with_offer_V3
  Scenario: The Issuer begins with an offer v3
    Given "CitizenV3" agent is running on "localhost" port "8081" with controller "https://localhost:8082"
    And "GovernmentV3" agent is running on "localhost" port "11011" with controller "https://localhost:11012"
    And "CitizenV3" has established connection with "GovernmentV3" through IssueCredential controller

    When  "GovernmentV3" sends an offer V3 to the "CitizenV3" through IssueCredential controller
    And "CitizenV3" accepts an offer and sends a request to the Issuer through IssueCredential controller
    And "GovernmentV3" accepts request V3 and sends credential to the Holder through IssueCredential controller
    And "CitizenV3" accepts credential with name "passportV3" through IssueCredential controller

    Then  "CitizenV3" checks that issued credential is being stored under "passportV3" name

  @issue_credential_controller_begin_with_proposal
  Scenario: The Holder begins with a proposal
    Given "Student" agent is running on "localhost" port "8081" with controller "https://localhost:8082"
      And "University" agent is running on "localhost" port "11011" with controller "https://localhost:11012"
      And "Student" has established connection with "University" through IssueCredential controller

    When  "Student" sends proposal credential to the "University" through IssueCredential controller
      And "University" accepts a proposal and sends an offer to the Holder through IssueCredential controller
      And "Student" accepts an offer and sends a request to the Issuer through IssueCredential controller
      And "University" accepts request and sends credential to the Holder through IssueCredential controller
      And "Student" accepts credential with name "degree" through IssueCredential controller

    Then  "Student" checks that issued credential is being stored under "degree" name

  @issue_credential_controller_begin_with_proposal_V3
  Scenario: The Holder begins with a proposal v3
    Given "StudentV3" agent is running on "localhost" port "8081" with controller "https://localhost:8082"
