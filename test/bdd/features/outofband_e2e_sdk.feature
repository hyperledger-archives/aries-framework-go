Feature: Out-Of-Band protocol (Go API)

  Background:
    Given all agents are using Media Type Profiles "didcomm/aip1,didcomm/aip2;env=rfc19,didcomm/aip2;env=rfc587,didcomm/v2"
    Given "Alice" agent is running on "localhost" port "random" with http-binding did resolver url "${SIDETREE_URL}" which accepts did method "sidetree"
      And "Bob" agent is running on "localhost" port "random" with http-binding did resolver url "${SIDETREE_URL}" which accepts did method "sidetree"

  Scenario Outline: handshake_protocols: yes | requests~attach: no | existing_conn: no
    Given options "<accept>"
      And "Alice" creates an out-of-band invitation
     When "Alice" sends the invitation to "Bob" through an out-of-band channel
      And "Bob" accepts the invitation and connects with "Alice"
     Then "Alice" and "Bob" confirm their connection is "completed"
    Examples:
      | accept                    |
      | "didcomm/aip1"            |
      | "didcomm/aip2;env=rfc19"  |
      | "didcomm/aip2;env=rfc587" |
      | "didcomm/v2"              |

  Scenario Outline: handshake_protocols: yes | requests~attach: yes | existing_conn: no
    Given options "<accept>"
      And "Alice" creates an out-of-band invitation with an attached offer-credential message
      And "Alice" sends the invitation to "Bob" through an out-of-band channel
      And "Bob" accepts the invitation and connects with "Alice"
     When "Bob" accepts the offer-credential message from "Alice"
     Then "Bob" is issued the credential
    Examples:
      | accept                    |
      | "didcomm/aip1"            |
      | "didcomm/aip2;env=rfc19"  |
      | "didcomm/aip2;env=rfc587" |
      | "didcomm/v2"              |

  Scenario Outline: handshake_protocols: yes | requests~attach: no | existing_conn: yes
    Given options "<accept>"
      And "Alice" creates an out-of-band invitation with a public DID
      And "Bob" connects with "Alice" using the invitation
     When "Alice" creates another out-of-band invitation with the same public DID
      And "Alice" sends the invitation to "Bob" through an out-of-band channel
      And "Bob" accepts the invitation from "Alice" and both agents opt to reuse their connections
     Then "Alice" and "Bob" confirm they reused their connections
    Examples:
      | accept                    |
      | "didcomm/aip1"            |
      | "didcomm/aip2;env=rfc19"  |
      | "didcomm/aip2;env=rfc587" |
      | "didcomm/v2"              |

  Scenario Outline: handshake_protocols: yes | requests~attach: yes | existing_conn: yes

      And "Bob" connects with "Alice" using the invitation

      And "Bob" accepts the offer-credential message from "Alice"
     Then "Bob" is issued the credential
    Examples:
      | accept                    |
      | "didcomm/aip1"            |
      | "didcomm/aip2;env=rfc19"  |
      | "didcomm/aip2;env=rfc587" |
      | "didcomm/v2"              |
