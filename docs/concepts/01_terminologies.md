# Terminologies

### Agent

An agent, in the context of self-sovereign identity, acts as a delegate of an individual identity; holds cryptographic keys to prove this responsibility; and interacts with other agents.

### DID

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity.
A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.

### DID Document

A set of data describing the DID subject, including mechanisms, such as public keys and pseudonymous biometrics, that the DID subject or a DID delegate can use to authenticate itself and prove its association with the DID.
A DID document may also contain other attributes or claims describing the DID subject.

### Holder

Also known as a prover, a holder is the entity to whom an [issuer](#issuer) issues a credential. Although the holder can request or propose that a credential be issued to them, they may not always be the subjects of a credential. 

In the [PresentProof](./00_what_is_hl_aries.md#8-presentproof-protocol) flow, the prover prepares the proof and presents it to the [verifier](#verifier).

### Issuer
The entity that issues a [credential](#verifiable-credential) to a holder.

### Verifiable Credential

A verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents. It is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.
Examples of verifiable credentials include digital employee identification cards, digital birth certificates, and digital educational certificates.

### Verifiable Presentation

A verifiable presentation expresses data from one or more verifiable credentials, and is packaged in such a way that the authorship of the data is verifiable.

_Reference: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations_

### Verifier

This is the entity who makes a request for a [credential](#verifiable-credential) or proof from a [holder](#holder) and verifies it.
