# Verifiable Credential Wallet

The aries-framework-go project can be used as verifiable credential wallet which can be used to manage credentials and related data models.

## Standards

Here are the major specification followed by aries verifiable credential wallet interfaces,
* [Universal Wallet](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/) - for wallet data models and interfaces.
* [Verifiable Presentation request Specifications](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vp-request-spec/) - for credential queries.
* [Presentation Exchange](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/) - for credential queries.

## How it works

#### Wallet Profiles
The aries verifiable credential wallet provides multi-tenancy, where all wallet users can use their own storage, keys and key management systems. 
Each wallet user can create their wallet profiles customized to their storage types, keys and key management systems. 
Refer [profile section](#creating-and-updating-wallet-profiles) for more details on how to manage profiles. 

Note: Each wallet profiles can have their own storage types (like leveldb, couchdb, EDV etc) and KMS (local or remote).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29631944/126654261-dc49eb29-5fa9-46cf-b189-b1773064e496.png)

* Storage - Agent creates new storage for each wallet profile during profile creation. 
Storage type is typically same as agent's storage type, but a profile can also be created using already configured EDV if wallet user wish to use 
EDV.
* Key Management - Each wallet profile uses its own key management system which can be configured during profile creation.
    * Local KMS - a wallet profile can be created simply by providing local KMS passphrase where agent will create namespaced local KMS instance for corresponding wallet user. 
    Then wallet will use the profile's local KMS instance for all key operations.
    * Remote KMS (Web KMS) - a wallet profile can be created using key server URL in case of remote KMS. 
    Then wallet will use the profile's remote key server URL for all key operations.

#### Opening & Closing Wallet
All of the wallet operations involves storage & key management systems and they need to be unlocked to be used. 
So wallet provides mechanism for opening and closing the wallet to unlock and lock storage and key management systems. A wallet can only be opened by authorization parameters like local KMS passphrase, web kms auth, EDV auth etc based on wallet user's profile settings.
More details about how to open a wallet can be found [here](#opening-a-wallet)

Opening a wallet creates storage and KMS instances using wallet user's profile settings and returns an auth token which can be used for subsequent wallet operations.
When wallet closes or token expires, those storage and KMS instances will be destroyed and performing a wallet operation later on with previous token will return an error.  
 
#### Managing Wallet Contents
Wallet contents will be stored in storage provider configured during wallet's profile creation. The aries verifiable credential wallet implements various universal wallet interfaces and data models 
and they will be discussed in detail in data models and interfaces sections below.

#### Verifiable Credential Operations
The aries verifiable credential wallet provides various verifiable credentials operations based on universal wallet specifications like issue, prove, verify, derive etc.
Refer data models and interfaces sections below for more details.


## Creating and Updating Wallet Profiles
* A wallet profile with local KMS can be created by providing passphrase or secret lock service option.
* A wallet profile with Remote KMS can be created by providing secret lock service option.
* A wallet profile with EDV as storage type can be created by providing EDV storage options like edv server URL, Vault ID, encryption key ID and mac operation key ID.
This profile will use [aries EDV client implementation](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/component/storage/edv) for performing encrypted data vault operations.

Refer Aries Go Docs for [ProfileOptions](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/pkg/wallet/options.go#L33-L69) for different options for creating wallet profiles.

> Aries Go SDK Sample for creating wallet profile
```
// creating wallet profile using local KMS passphrase
err := vcwallet.CreateProfile(sampleUserID, ctx, wallet.WithPassphrase(samplePassPhrase))

// creating wallet profile using local KMS secret lock service
err = vcwallet.CreateProfile(sampleUserID, ctx, wallet.WithSecretLockService(mySecretLockSvc}))

// createing wallet profile using remote KMS & EDV
err := vcwallet.CreateProfile(sampleUserID, ctx,
wallet.WithKeyServerURL(keyServerURL), 
wallet.WithEDVStorage(edvServerURL, vaultID, encryptionKID,macKID))
```

Aries wallet APIs also provides ``UpdateProfile`` functions for updating wallet profiles. Care should be taken while using this function wallet might lose existing contents or keys by changing storage or key management systems.

## Opening a Wallet

Wallet can be opened by parameters related to profile settings of the wallet user.

For example,
* A wallet can be unlocked by local KMS passphrase or secret service only if wallet profile is configured to use local KMS for its key operations.
* A wallet user has to provide EDV unlock auth if wallet profile is configured to use EDV as a content store.

Opening a wallet returns a auth token which expires when wallet is closed or when life time of the token passes.

> Aries Go SDK Sample for opening a wallet for profile using local KMS settings - 1.
```
// creating vcwallet instance for user with local KMS settings.
myWallet, err := vcwallet.New(sampleUserID, ctx)

// opening a wallet with local KMS passphrase and getting a token for subsequent use.
err = myWallet.Open(wallet.WithUnlockByPassphrase(samplePassPhrase))

```

> Aries Go SDK Sample for opening a wallet with expiry for profile using local KMS settings.
```
// creating vcwallet instance for user with local KMS settings.
myWallet, err := vcwallet.New(sampleUserID, ctx)

// opening a wallet with local KMS secret lock service and getting a token for subsequent use.
err = myWallet.Open(wallet.WithUnlockBySecretLockService(mySecretLockSvc), wallet.WithUnlockExpiry(10 * time.Second))

```

> Aries Go SDK Sample for opening a wallet for profile using web KMS.
```
// creating vcwallet instance for user with web KMS settings.
myWallet, err := vcwallet.New(sampleUserID, ctx)

// opening a wallet with web kms auth options and getting a token for subsequent use.
err = myWallet.Open(wallet.WithUnlockWebKMSOptions(opts...))

```

> Aries Go SDK Sample for opening a wallet for profile using web KMS & EDV.
```
// creating vcwallet instance for user with web KMS settings.
myWallet, err := vcwallet.New(sampleUserID, ctx)

// opening a wallet with web kms auth options and getting a token for subsequent use.
err = myWallet.Open(wallet.WithUnlockWebKMSOptions(opts...), wallet.WithUnlockEDVOptions(opts...))

```

Refer Go Docs for [UnlockOptions](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/pkg/wallet/options.go#L92-L140) various wallet unlock options.


## Closing a Wallet

A wallet can be closed by simply calling ``Close`` function on wallet. It returns `true` when wallet is closed or `false` if wallet is already closed.

> Aries Go SDK Sample for closing a wallet.
```
// creating vcwallet instance for user with local KMS settings.
myWallet, err := vcwallet.New(sampleUserID, ctx)

// opening a wallet with local KMS passphrase and getting a token for subsequent use.
err = myWallet.Open(wallet.WithUnlockByPassphrase(samplePassPhrase))

//... perform your operation

// close the wallet,
ok := myWallet.Close() // returns true

```


## Supported Data Models
Currently aries verifiable credential wallet supports following data models from universal wallet,
* [Collection](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#Collection) - used for grouping wallet contents. Once added to the wallet content store, the collection ID can be used to map a content of any type. 
So a customized request can be sent to the wallet to get list of all the contents mapped to a given collection ID and content type. 
For example, getting list of credentials from wallet for a collection called 'My Financial Credentials'. 
* [Credential](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#Credential) - a verifiable credential data model. Once saved, the ID of the credential can be used directly for various operations verify, prove, derive etc.
* [DIDResolutionResponse](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#DIDResolutionResponse) - a DID document resolution data model which can be saved in wallet for subsequent use for issue, prove, derive, verify operations.
Wallet will use DID document resolution data model from content store while resolving DIDs and it falls back to agent's VDR only if it is not found. This model will be very handy for offline usage of wallet. 
* [Metadata](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#metadata) - can be used to save any wallet implementation specific custom data. 
For example, saving user's default signing profile info like signature type, controller, verification method.
* [Connection](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#connection) - used for saving DIDComm connections.
* [Key](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#Key) - key data model, once added to wallet private key from this data model will be imported into wallet profile's key management system. 
Supports both JWK (all curve types supported by aries framework go) & Base58 (Ed25519Signature2018 and Bls12381G1Key2020 key types). This data model is useful in importing keys into wallet.

## Wallet Interfaces
The aries verifiable credential wallet provides provides various wallet interfaces including the ones implemented from universal wallet specifications.

#### [Add](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#add)
This interface to be used for adding a data model to the wallet. Except `Key` data model all the data models will be added wallet content store. 
In case of `Key` data model, private key from data model gets imported into wallet profile's key management system.

Params,
* content type - type of the data model
* content - raw content
* options - like collection ID

Returns,
* error - if operation fails.


 > Aries Go SDK Sample for adding a content to wallet.
 ```
 // creating vcwallet instance.
 myWallet, err := vcwallet.New(sampleUserID, ctx)
 
 // open wallet.
 err = myWallet.Open(...)
 
 // add credential to wallet.
 err = myWallet.Add(wallet.Credential, rawCredential)
 
 // add credential to wallet with collection ID.
 err = myWallet.Add(wallet.Credential, sampleCredential,  wallet.AddByCollection(collectionID))
 
 // add a DID Document.
 err = myWallet.Add(wallet.DIDResolutionResponse, resolvedDID)
 
 // close wallet.
 ok = myWallet.Close()
  
 ```
Note: It is always recommended that a data model which is being added to wallet content store has an ID. If a data model does not have an ID then wallet will use UUID as a key (for remove, get operations).
User `GetAll` interface to list wallet contents and their keys.
